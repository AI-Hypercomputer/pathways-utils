# Colocated Python

## Purpose

This package provides the Colocated Python Sidecar implementation. It describes how to build the sidecar container image with custom Python dependencies. This sidecar container runs on the TPU workers and facilitates remote Python code execution, enabling seamless integration between the user code and Python-based tasks on the TPU worker.

**Why use Colocated Python?**

Colocated Python enables users to execute code that runs explicitly on a specified set of TPU VMs using simple annotations and sharding information. This increases throughput on data or I/O intensive tasks like data loading (as implemented in [MaxText's RemoteIterator class](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/391a5a788d85cae8942334b042fdabdbd549af51/MaxText/multihost_dataloading.py#L175)).

## Examples

### Simple (No User Dependencies)

The following small example is modified from [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/blob/f4c727abb3989048f49e3d9a4bf2e4052969974b/tests/colocated_python_test.py#L78-L89) with no additional user dependencies installed. It shows how you can use the JAX Colocated Python API to create a file on the specified TPU worker.

```python
import jax
from jax.experimental import colocated_python
from jax.experimental.colocated_python import serialization

@colocated_python.colocated_python
def create_a_file(dummy):
  """
  Creates a simple file on the TPU worker.
  """
  filename = "my_new_file.txt"
  content_to_write = f"This is written on TPU worker {jax.process_id}"

  try:
    with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
      file.write(content_to_write)
      print(f"Content written to '{filename}'.")

    print(f"File '{filename}' created and closed.")
  except IOError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

  return dummy

devices = jax.devices()
dummy_array = np.array(1)
dummy_array = jax.device_put(dummy_array, devices[0])

out = create_a_file(dummy_array)
```

### Medium (With User Dependencies)

What if you want to add your own dependencies to do more advanced logic?

The following is a simple line chart of the first 5 primes in matplotlib that is saved locally to the TPU worker.

```python
import jax
import numpy as np
from jax.experimental import colocated_python
from jax.experimental.colocated_python import serialization

# User added dependency
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

@colocated_python.colocated_python
def create_and_save_primes_plot(dummy):
  """
  Creates a simple matplotlib line plot and saves it as a PNG image
  on the TPU worker.
  """
  worker_id = jax.process_id()
  plot_filename = f"simple_line_plot_worker_{worker_id}.png"

  # Sample data for the plot
  x_data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
  y_data = np.array([2, 3, 5, 7, 11])

  try:
    # Create the line plot
    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
    plt.plot(x_data, y_data, marker='o', linestyle='-')

    # Add labels and title
    plt.xlabel("Nth Prime")
    plt.ylabel("Primes")
    plt.title(f"Simple Plot from TPU Worker {worker_id}")
    plt.grid(True)

    # Save the plot to the specified file
    plt.savefig(plot_filename)
    print(f"Plot successfully saved to '{plot_filename}' on worker {worker_id}.")

    plt.close()
  except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred on worker {worker_id} while creating/saving the plot: {e}")

  return dummy

devices = jax.devices()
dummy_np_array = np.array(1, dtype=np.float32)
dummy_device_array = jax.device_put(dummy_np_array, devices[0])
out = create_and_save_plot(dummy_device_array)
```

### Advanced Usage (With User Dependencies and Control Flow Logic)

For more advanced usage (such as data loading), check out [MaxText's RemoteIterator class](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/391a5a788d85cae8942334b042fdabdbd549af51/MaxText/multihost_dataloading.py#L175).

See Installation and Usage for instructions on how to use MaxText out of the box with this feature.

### Verification

To verify files were created, SSH into one of the TPU workers using the following command and check that the file was created.

`kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -- /bin/sh -c "cat my_new_file.txt"`

Logs can also be verified by tailing the pod.

`kubectl logs -f <pod_name>`

## Installation and Usage

Follow these steps to set up, build, and deploy your application with the Colocated Python sidecar.

**Prerequisites**

Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed on your system along with [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). Ensure you are authenticated into gcloud and Docker is configured for your region. For Google Artifact Registry, you typically run a command like this (replace `REGION` with the region of your repository, e.g., `us-east5`):

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth configure-docker REGION-docker.pkg.dev
```

**1. Clone the Repository**

Get the necessary code and scripts.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/pathways-utils.git
cd pathways-utils/sidecar/python
```

**2. Prepare Sidecar Dependencies**

Update the file named `requirements.txt`. List all the additional Python packages you need specifically for the sidecar environment, one package per line.

These dependencies may be the same as your main workload's dependencies.

```
# Example requirements.txt
jax>=0.5.1
tensorflow-datasets
tiktoken
grain-nightly>=0.0.10
```

**3. Build the Colocated Python Sidecar Image and upload it to Artifact Registry**

Use the provided Dockerfile to create the sidecar image. This image will contain the required dependencies in your `requirements.txt`. Also specify the image location to upload to in Artifact Registry

```bash
export PROJECT_ID=<your_project_id>
export LOCAL_IMAGE_NAME=my-colocated-python-server
export JAX_VERSION=0.5.3

docker build --build-arg JAX_VERSION=${JAX_VERSION} -t ${LOCAL_IMAGE_NAME} .
```

Now you can upload the image to Google Artifact Registry. If you do not have an Artifact Registry repository, please follow the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/repositories/create-repos) to create one.

```bash
export REGION=us  # Your Region
export ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_REPO=YOUR_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_REPO
export EXPORTED_IMAGE_LOCATION=${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/${ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_REPO}/my-colocated-python:latest

docker tag ${LOCAL_IMAGE_NAME} ${EXPORTED_IMAGE_LOCATION}
docker push ${EXPORTED_IMAGE_LOCATION}

# Delete the local image as it's no longer needed.
docker image rm ${LOCAL_IMAGE_NAME}
```

**4. Update Deployment Configuration**

***Simple Example***

Modify your Kubernetes deployment YAML file to use your colocated python sidecar image. This assumes you are using the [pathways-job](https://github.com/google/pathways-job) api.

For example, if using 2 v4-16 TPUs, use the following yaml. This example is modified from [pathways-job](https://github.com/google/pathways-job/blob/main/config/samples/colocated_python_example_pathwaysjob.yaml).

If you do not have an existing GCS Bucket, instructions to create one are [here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets).

```yaml
apiVersion: pathways-job.pathways.domain/v1
kind: PathwaysJob
metadata:
  name: pathways-colocated
spec:
  maxRestarts: 0
  customComponents:
  - componentType: colocated_python_sidecar
    image: <location of your colocated python sidecar server image>
  workers:
  - type: ct4p-hightpu-4t
    topology: 2x2x2
    numSlices: 2
  pathwaysDir: "gs://<test-bucket>/tmp" # This bucket needs to be created in advance.
  controller:
    # Pod template for training, default mode.
    deploymentMode: default
    mainContainerName: main
    template: # UserPodTemplate
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: main
          image: python:3.12
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          command:
          - /bin/sh
          - -c
          - |
            pip install --upgrade pip
            pip install -U --pre jax jaxlib -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_nightly_releases.html
            pip install pathwaysutils
            python -c "import jax; import pathwaysutils; print(\"Number of JAX devices is\", len(jax.devices()))"
```

***MaxText Reference Example***

If using MaxText, to turn on the data loading optimization that uses Colocated Python feature.

```python
colocated_python_data_input=True
```

**5. Deploy the Application**

Apply the updated deployment configuration to your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f path/to/your/deployment.yaml
```

This will create the necessary pods with your application, pathways head, and the Colocated Python sidecar containers.

## The Sharp Bits ðŸ”ª

**User Dependency Conflicts**

Colocated Python relies on specific internal dependencies, including JAX. Refer to the provided `server_requirements.txt` for the complete list of required dependencies. Using a different dependency version than the one provided in `server_requirements.txt` will cause the Colocated Python image build to fail.
